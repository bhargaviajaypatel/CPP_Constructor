# CPP_Constructor
In C++, constructor is a special method which is invoked automatically at the time of object creation.
It is used to initialize the data members of new object generally.
The constructor in C++ has the same name as class or structure.
To create a constructor, use the same name as the class, followed by parentheses ().
